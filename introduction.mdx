Get started with Wumpus.js, a framework for building Discord bots with TypeScript. Wumpus.js is designed to be simple, flexible, and efficient. It provides a set of tools and utilities to help you build and maintain your Discord bot with ease.

<Info>
  Currently our library is in the early stages of development. We are working hard to provide you with a stable and feature-rich library. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository.

  **Note:** This documentation is still a work in progress. We are constantly updating and improving it. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository.

<Warning>
  For at the moment, we use Discord.js as the main library for interacting with the Discord API. We are planning to switch to raw Discord Gateway & REST API in the future.
