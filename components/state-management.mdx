title: 'State Management'
description: 'This system is a state-driven framework within the Wumpus Discord bot, designed to manage interactive messages dynamically. It allows you to handle Discord interactions (like button presses) by updating a central state, automatically re-rendering embeds and buttons as necessary.'

## Overview

By leveraging this system, developers can create sophisticated, real-time interactions in a modular way. It abstracts the complexity of manually handling user inputs and state changes, making it easier to create responsive, interactive bots that maintain state across interactions.

The system is composed of several key classes and entities, such as:

-   **Stator**: The state manager that registers and handles the stateful components.
-   **ReactiveEmbed**: Defines interactive Discord embeds that react to state changes.
-   **ReactiveState**: Manages the reactive state of the embed.
-   **State Entity**: Stores persistent state in the database for recovery across sessions.

### General Architecture

The architecture of the system revolves around managing state reactively, allowing the UI (buttons and embeds) to reflect the current state automatically. Each interaction with a button triggers a state update, and the system ensures the UI is re-rendered with the new state values. This creates a smooth, consistent user experience.

## Stator

### Purpose

The `Stator` class serves as the main state manager in the bot, keeping track of all active `ReactiveEmbed` instances. It listens to button interactions and forwards them to the correct `ReactiveEmbed` based on a unique identifier.

### Properties

<ResponseField name="client" type="Wumpus" required>
	The instance of the bot’s client that interacts with Discord.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="reactives" type="Map<string, ReactiveEmbed>" required>
	A map of currently registered `ReactiveEmbed` instances, keyed by their
	unique identifier.
</ResponseField>

### Methods

<ResponseField name="constructor" type="Function => void">
  Initializes the `Stator` with the bot client.

**Args:**

  <ResponseField name="client" type="Wumpus">
  The client object.
  </ResponseField>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="handle" type="Function">
 Handles button interactions by locating the correct `ReactiveEmbed` based on its identifier.

  <Expandable title="Parameters">
    <ResponseField name="identifier" type="string">
      The identifier of the `ReactiveEmbed` instance handling the interaction.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="interaction" type="ButtonInteraction">
      The `ButtonInteraction` received from Discord.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="state" type="State">
      The current state of the embed, passed during the interaction.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="buttonIdentifier" type="string">
      The unique identifier of the button pressed.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## ReactiveEmbed

### Purpose

`ReactiveEmbed` is the core component of this system, defining a dynamic, interactive message that can change based on user actions. It manages its own state (using `ReactiveState`), a template for rendering the embed, and the associated buttons that users can interact with.

When a button is pressed, `ReactiveEmbed` updates its state, rerenders the embed with the new data, and sends an updated message back to Discord.

### Properties

<ResponseField name="identifier" type="string">
A unique identifier for the embed, used to reference it within the `Stator` system.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="state" type="ReactiveState">
An instance of `ReactiveState` that holds the current state of the embed. Any changes to the state automatically trigger updates.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="embedTemplate" type="EmbedTemplate">
A predefined template for rendering the embed. The template may include dynamic fields that depend on the current state.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="buttons" type="Function<Button[]>">
  A function that returns an array of buttons to be rendered with the embed, based on the current state.

  <Expandable title="Parameters">
    <ResponseField name="state" type="DeepReactive">
      The current state
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="reactive" type="ReactiveState">
      The main state holder object for methods like `partial`.

## ReactiveState

### Purpose

The `ReactiveState` class is responsible for managing the internal state of a `ReactiveEmbed`. It ensures that state changes trigger updates to the UI, and it notifies relevant components whenever a particular state value is modified.

This class implements a "reactive" system by using deeply nested objects that trigger updates when any part of the state is modified.

#### Properties

<Warning>Updating this value manually may produce unexpected results.</Warning>
<ResponseField name="_state" type="DeepReactive">
	The current reactive state of the embed, which is deeply nested and can
	trigger updates at any level.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="handlers" type="Record">
	A collection of handler functions, keyed by the name of the state property
	they monitor.
	<Expandable title="Record Structure">

		</ResponseField>
		<ResponseField name="value" type="Function[]">

			</Expandable>
		</ResponseField>
	</Expandable>
</ResponseField>

    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## State Entity

### Purpose

The `State` entity represents a database record that stores the current state of a `ReactiveEmbed`. By persisting state to the database, the system can recover state across bot restarts or when an interaction occurs later. Each state record corresponds to a unique `ReactiveEmbed` and holds the serialized state data.

### Properties

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
	The unique identifier for the state record, used to reference it in the
	database.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="state" type="Object">
	The serialized state data stored as JSON.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="identifier" type="string">
	The unique identifier for the `ReactiveEmbed` this state belongs to.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="createdAt" type="Date">
	The timestamp for when this state record was created.
</ResponseField>

## Additional Notes

<Info>
	**Localization**: The `ReactiveEmbed` system supports localization for both
	embed content and button labels. Developers should provide localized strings
	for each supported locale, using the appropriate keys in the `EmbedTemplate`
	and `Button` definitions.
</Info>
<Info>
	**State Persistence**: By default, the `State` entity allows state to be
	stored persistently in a database. This ensures that `ReactiveEmbed`
	instances can resume their previous state after bot restarts or when
	interactions are handled over time.
</Info>
<Warning>
	**Button Identifier Uniqueness**: Ensure that all button identifiers are
	globally unique. If two buttons share the same identifier, interactions may
	be incorrectly routed.
</Warning>
