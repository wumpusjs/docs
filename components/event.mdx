## Components

### Event Class

The `Event` class is the core of the Events System, representing a single event handler.

#### Properties

<ResponseField name="once" type="boolean" default="false">
  If true, the event handler will only be executed once and then removed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="event" type="Events" required>
  The Discord event that this handler is responsible for (e.g., 'messageCreate', 'interactionCreate').
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="execute" type="(...args: any[]) => void" required>
  The function that will be executed when the event occurs.
</ResponseField>

#### Constructor

```typescript
constructor(options: EventOptions<Events>)
```

Creates a new Event instance with the specified options.

### EventOptions Interface

The `EventOptions` interface defines the structure for creating an Event.

<ResponseField name="once" type="boolean" optional>
  Specifies if the event should only be executed once.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="event" type="Event" required>
  The Discord event to handle.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="execute" type="(args: ClientEvents[Event], client: Wumpus) => void" required>
  The function to execute when the event occurs.
</ResponseField>

## Utility Functions

### getEvents

```typescript
getEvents(): Promise<{ success: boolean, files: string[] }>
```

Retrieves all event files from the `./src/events` directory.

### loadEvents

```typescript
loadEvents(client: Wumpus): Promise<void>
```

Loads all event handlers and registers them with the MiddlewareManager.

## Usage

### Creating an Event Handler

To create a new event handler, create a new file in the `./src/events` directory:

```typescript
import Event from '../classes/Event';
import { Message } from 'discord.js';

export default new Event({
  event: 'messageCreate',
  execute: (args: [Message], client: Wumpus) => {
    const [message] = args;
    console.log(`Received message: ${message.content}`);
  }
});
```

### Loading Events

The `loadEvents` function is typically called during the bot's initialization process:

```typescript
import { loadEvents } from './utils';

async function initializeBot() {
  const client = new Wumpus();
  await loadEvents(client);
  // ... other initialization steps
}
```

## Event Loading Process

1. The `loadEvents` function is called with the Wumpus client instance.
2. It retrieves all event files using `getEvents()`.
3. For each event file:
   - It imports the exported content.
   - Verifies that the exported content is an instance of `Event`.
   - Creates a new `Middleware` instance for the event.
   - Adds the middleware to the client's MiddlewareManager.

## Advanced Usage

### One-time Events

To create an event that only fires once:

```typescript
export default new Event({
  event: 'ready',
  once: true,
  execute: (args, client) => {
    console.log(`Bot is ready! Logged in as ${client.instance.user?.tag}`);
  }
});
```

### Accessing Client in Events

The client instance is passed to the execute function, allowing access to all client properties and methods:

```typescript
export default new Event({
  event: 'messageCreate',
  execute: (args: [Message], client: Wumpus) => {
    const [message] = args;
    if (message.content === '!ping') {
      message.reply(`Pong! Latency is ${client.instance.ws.ping}ms.`);
    }
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep each event handler in a separate file for better organization.
2. Use TypeScript to ensure type safety for event arguments.
3. Utilize the `once` option for events that should only occur once, like the 'ready' event.
4. Handle errors within your event handlers to prevent unhandled exceptions.
5. Use the client parameter in your event handlers to access bot-wide functionality and data.

## Notes

<Note>
The Events System integrates seamlessly with the Middleware System, allowing for a flexible and powerful event handling architecture.
</Note>

<Warning>
Ensure that your event files export a default instance of the Event class. The loader will ignore any file that doesn't follow this pattern.
</Warning>

<Info>
The system automatically converts event handlers into middlewares, allowing them to benefit from the middleware chain's features.
